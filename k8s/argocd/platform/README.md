# Platform Services
This is where we can define platform level workloads we want managed via OpenShift GitOps.
This folder is referenced by an ApplicationSet in the bootstrap config YAML.

## Current List
* GitOps Controller (ArgoCD)
* Service Mesh (Istio) - version in the .yaml
* more coming - API gateway, SSO, etc
