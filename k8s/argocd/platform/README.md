This is where we can define platform level workloads we want managed via OpenShift GitOps.
This folder is defined an ApplicationSet in the bootstrap config YAML.

## Current List
* OpenShift Operators Prep (Core Resources)
* GitOps Controller (cyclical to rhpds overlay)
* Service Mesh
* more coming - API gateway, SSO, etc
